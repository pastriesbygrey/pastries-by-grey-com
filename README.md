2. `cd` to the directory you downloaded it in, and download the theme submodules:

  `cd ./pastries-by-grey-com/`
  
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`
  
3. Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io)

  * via `brew`: `brew install hugo`

4. Lastly you can run `hugo serve` and open view the built site in your browser!
